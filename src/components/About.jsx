      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I am a healthcare worker turned coder! I have worked in healthcare for
        the past 6 years, and now I am looking to start a new career in
        programming. I love to learn! I am constantly searching for new things
        to do and learn in order to keep my mind active. I also love problem
        solving. I am the go-to person when it comes to figuring out why certain
        things do not work, and I enjoy taking the time to help others resolve
        their issues.
        <br>
        </br>
        Jumping into this field was intimidating at first, but the
        more I have learned through the Bootcamp, the more exciting all of this
        has become! It has been quite an exciting journey so far, and I look
        forward to learning more things as I become more proficient in the
        coding world!
